# Design

Decided to go with No-Sql DB here, as data model is dynamic and subjected change unlike structured data.

1. Initial DB Model is explained here - https://github.com/pavan-nw/stock-admin/wiki/No-SQL-DB-Model
2. Supported operations are listed here - https://github.com/pavan-nw/stock-admin/wiki/Operations
3. API design information  - https://github.com/pavan-nw/stock-admin/wiki/API-Documentation
